\caption{The table shows average time spent on each of the EMIS tabs and average pieces of information looked at and their standard deviations. The pieces of information for "problems" and "medications" represent count of rows in the respective tabs. It was more complicated than just row counts to quantify pieces of information looked at in the investigations and consultation tabs. That is why they are left empty.}
